a. CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundation of information security. It represents three core principles:

Confidentiality

Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized users.

Prevents unauthorized access or disclosure.

Examples:

Using passwords, encryption, and access control lists.

Integrity

Ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and unaltered.

Protects information from being modified or destroyed by unauthorized users.

Examples:

Hashing, checksums, and digital signatures.

Availability

Ensures that data and systems are available to authorized users when needed.

Protects against service interruptions and downtime.

Examples:

Backups, redundancy, disaster recovery, and DDoS protection.

b. Key Security Concepts

Threat

Any potential cause of an unwanted incident that may harm a system or organization.

Example: Malware, phishing attack, insider threat.

Weakness

A flaw or defect in a system that can make it more vulnerable to attack.

Example: Weak passwords, unpatched software.

Vulnerability

A specific weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.

Example: SQL Injection flaw in a website.

Exploit

A piece of code or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability.

Example: Malware that uses an OS vulnerability to gain admin access.

Payload

The part of the exploit that performs the malicious action once the vulnerability is exploited.

Example: A ransomware payload that encrypts files after gaining access.

c. CVE and CWE

CVE – Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

A public database of known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Each CVE entry has a unique ID (e.g., CVE-2024-12345).

Maintained by MITRE Corporation.

Purpose: Helps security professionals identify and track specific vulnerabilities.

Example:

CVE-2017-0144 – The EternalBlue exploit used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.

CWE – Common Weakness Enumeration

A catalog of software weakness types that can lead to vulnerabilities.

Focuses on the root causes of security issues.

Example:

CWE-79 – Improper Neutralization of Input (Cross-Site Scripting).

CWE-89 – SQL Injection.
| **Aspect** | **CVE**                       | **CWE**                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Focus      | Specific vulnerability        | General type of weakness                    |
| Example    | CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)    | CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) |
| Managed By | MITRE                         | MITRE                                       |
| Use        | Identify known security flaws | Identify coding or design weaknesses        |
