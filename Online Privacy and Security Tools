a. VPNs, Proxies, and Tor
1. VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A VPN encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a secure server.

It hides your IP address and protects data from hackers or surveillance.

Main Features:

Encrypts all traffic between your device and the VPN server.

Masks your real location.

Useful on public Wi-Fi for security.

Advantages:

Strong encryption.

Works for all apps on your device.

Bypasses geo-restrictions (e.g., Netflix, websites).

Disadvantages:

May reduce internet speed.

Requires trust in the VPN provider.

2. Proxy Server

A proxy acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet.

It changes your IP address but does not encrypt your traffic (unlike VPN).

Main Features:

Hides your IP for basic anonymity.

Often used to bypass website restrictions or filters.

Advantages:

Good for browsing or accessing blocked sites.

Lightweight and easy to set up.

Disadvantages:

No encryption → traffic can be monitored.

Only works for specific applications or browsers.

3. Tor (The Onion Router)

Tor is a network that routes traffic through multiple volunteer-operated servers (nodes) to anonymize users.

Each relay adds a layer of encryption — like an onion.

Main Features:

Provides strong anonymity.

Access to .onion websites on the dark web.

Advantages:

High privacy and anonymity.

Free and open-source.

Disadvantages:

Slow connection due to multiple relays.

Some websites block Tor users.

Misuse for illegal activities by some users.

b. Web Layers: Surface Web, Deep Web, and Dark Web
1. Surface Web

The part of the internet that is indexed by search engines (Google, Bing, etc.).

Accessible to everyone using normal browsers.

Examples: Wikipedia, YouTube, News websites.

Est. size: Less than 5% of the total web.

2. Deep Web

Portion of the web not indexed by search engines.

Requires login credentials or special permissions.

Used for private or internal data.

Examples:

Online banking portals

Email inboxes

Cloud storage

Academic or government databases

Purpose: Legitimate and secure — not illegal.

3. Dark Web

A subset of the Deep Web that requires special software (like Tor) to access.

Sites often use the “.onion” domain.

Offers anonymity for both users and site owners.

Examples:

Anonymous forums

Whistleblower platforms (like SecureDrop)

Black markets (illegal activity)

Caution: Contains both legal and illegal content.
